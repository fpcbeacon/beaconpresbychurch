## Our Vision

**Bridging Worlds. Encountering God. Healing Lives.** 

> First Presbyterian Church is a community of deep roots. We have been worshiping God at the foot of Mount Beacon since 1832. We love God, care for each other, and serve our community. The nearby Hudson gives life in the muddy mixing of different waters. Likewise, we experience Jesus Christ’s transforming presence when we authentically share joys and struggles of our diverse lives. Come as you are. We love music, food, and forming real relationships. Working together, and with partners in the community, we strive to help each other blossom into the fullness of who the Holy Spirit calls us to be. As changed people, we are called to change the world.

**Our Pastor’s Page
Welcome to the website of Beacon First Presbyterian Church!
I am excited that you have come searching. Located in the city of Beacon, considered an artist
hub, artists are plentiful in our congregation. We have a great arts community, and many who work

in NYC have chosen to live here.
I have been here serving as pastor for about a year and a half and have
been impressed by the people and leadership.
  As the Body of Christ, we are Easter People, living into the Life-giving Spirit of
Jesus Christ, bringing hope and new life to all people. We are a community where
honest questions are valued, and faith is considered a process, not an arrival.
    We affirm that every person has worth as a unique creation and a child of God. In
the name of Jesus Christ, we welcome into full participation persons of every age,
sex, race, color, ethnicity, culture, immigration status, political affiliation, economic
condition, physical and mental ability, marital status, sexual orientation, and gender identity. We hope that
whoever you are, wherever you come from, whatever your background, whomever you love, that you will
find just what you need here.
Come see for yourself!
Our worship is inclusive, all can participate. It is a combination of traditional and
contemporary, and there is always a place for children.
-If you are looking for a place to belong, Beacon First Pres. is a loving and caring
congregation.
-If you are looking for a place to learn more about the God who created us all, whose name
is Love, then venture to check us out.
-If you have questions, so do we. If you have doubts, share them. These are honest
aspects of journeying in faith. No question is invalid. We don’t have all the answers, I
certainly don’t, but I would love to explore together. That is what I try to do on Sundays
as well. God’s Spirit is all compassion and comfort and will guide us. if weWelcome to the website of Beacon First Presbyterian Church!

-If you want a place to contribute to making this community, this world, a better place, to be
part of something bigger, Beacon First Presbyterian Church is at work striving to do
just that.
We open our doors for the Welcome Table, which serves free meals every Friday and
Saturday mornings. We also have a Tiny Food Pantry on our property, filled daily. It is there
inviting people to take what they need, leave what they can. And members from the
community do both. Some take what they need, others share with us by bringing food to
contribute to the food.
Our next project is to update this website, so come back again and see us. Contact us if
you want to talk or connect. I would love to talk together, share thoughts and ideas. We can
do this via text, or email, or in person! Call and leave a message and I will get back to you. I
would love to meet together and just chat.

It is because Christ loves us that we love each other.
We choose welcome, compassion, and grace.

May the Lord bless you and keep you and give you peace.
In Christ’s love and shalom,
Rev. Eileen
