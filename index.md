## Support for Ukrainian Refugees <img title="Ukrainian Flag" src="images/ukraine-whatsapp.png" width="30"></img>

Friends, Presbyterian Disaster Assistance, a program of PCUSA's Presbyterian Mission, is making a special appeal to support their work with Ukrainian refugees. First Presbyterian will be conducting a second collection for this appeal. On Sunday, March 13. If you wish to give online or learn more about PDA's work in the US & around the world, visit [PCUSA.ORG/UKRAINE22](pcusa.org/UKRAINE22). Thank you!

## In-Person Worship
First Presbyterian has resumed in-person worship services, Sunday mornings at 10am.  Masks are required indoors, regardless of vaccination status, but we welcome all back to worship after this long period away!

## Online Worship
For those who are unable or uncomfortable attending in-person gatherings, we invite you to continue participating in our online gatherings! Our ministry is active online with weekly services on our [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/FPCBNY) and [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/user/BeaconPresbyChurch).

## Our Vision

**Bridging Worlds. Encountering God. Healing Lives.** 

> First Presbyterian Church is a community of deep roots. We have been worshiping God at the foot of Mount Beacon since 1832. We love God, care for each other, and serve our community. The nearby Hudson gives life in the muddy mixing of different waters. Likewise, we experience Jesus Christ’s transforming presence when we authentically share joys and struggles of our diverse lives. Come as you are. We love music, food, and forming real relationships. Working together, and with partners in the community, we strive to help each other blossom into the fullness of who the Holy Spirit calls us to be. As changed people, we are called to change the world.
