I am sustained by the deep sense of God’s abiding presence and am grateful for the gift of serving a church where adventure is possible, all are welcome, and asking questions and trying new things are an authentic part of the journey. I, along with my fellow travelers in faith, make our way in a broken world, with a heart for social justice as we continue to embody acts of love, grace, and kindness as the hands and feet of Christ in the world.  I love to study Scripture where I continually find joy and new depths of understanding, for I believe that God’s words are for all times and places. Sharing the challenge and the comfort of Jesus Christ is the fascinating and daunting calling for me as I walk beside these people of compassion, as we strive to encounter God, build bridges, and heal lives through the love and grace of Jesus Christ.

Our congregation reminds me of the early church. We care for one another and those who join us as we gather for worship each Sunday. Seasonally, we offer the sanctuary for evening Quiet Church, and we come together for Brunch Worship on the third Sunday of the month where we bring and share food and soul food. Our services are warm, welcoming, and relaxed, and children are valued and have a prominent place as we continue to explore new ways to be the church both inside and outside our walls. 

I have 4 adult children and 4 grandkiddos who light up my life.  I enjoy the arts, reading a good book, studying theology, walking by the water, biking, good food and great conversations. I have a pooch named Priscilla who keeps me out and walking, and I am enjoying the charming town of Beacon and all it has to offer.

And I am open for coffee and getting to know anyone who is interested in getting to know us. Give a call to the church and we can set something up! Church Office: 845 831 5322
